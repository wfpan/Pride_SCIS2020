# WDCCN
This directory contains the WDCCN that we built for all the subject systems used in our experiments. There are three versions of WDCCN according to the different weighting mechanism. Note that the whole data set will be available after our work's acceptance. Of course, interested readers can email us to get the whole data set in advance. Please use your institutional email address. Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn.

# Pride.jar
Pride.jar is a small part of our own developped software, SNAP. Of course, the SNAP software can be obtained by email to us. Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn.

# How to use our data set and software
The steps to use Pride.jar is shown as follows. To run the software, you should install the jdk (java development kit) 1.6 (or higher) first in your computer. JDK can be downloaded from https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
- Download the Pride.jar and the data set file to the same directory.
- Double-click the Pride.jar
- Select File->Open a WDCCN file...
- Browse the WDCCN directory and select a specific WDCCN file (end with .net).
- Select Analysis->ClassRank
- Then you will get the ClassRank PageRank value for each class. You can also find a file storing the obtained results in the corresponding directory.
